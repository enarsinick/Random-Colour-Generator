This is a random colour generator built using vanilla JavaScript, the program generates a random hexadecimal colour value and then displays that value on the page for the user to use.

This is a small little test project to build out my skills using JavaScript. A link for the live project can be found [here](http://nickcave.co/colourgenerator/).
